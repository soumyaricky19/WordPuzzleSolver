# WordPuzzleSolver

Objectives:

     Create a hash table.
     Use the hash table to solve a word puzzle.


Description:

     A grid consisting of letters is to be checked against a dictionary of words
     to see if the grid contains any of the words.

     The user can input a value for the rows and columns of the grid and the program
     will create a grid of random characters.

     The program will read in a dictionary file (provided) and check if any of the
     words exist in the grid, considering 8 possible directions (horizontal, vertical,
     diagonal).

     The checking for words will be performed in one of three ways:

     a) when the dictionary list is kept in a linked list.
     b) when the dictionary list is kept in a tree.
     c) when the dictionary list is kept in a hash table.
